			<p> Mapsafe plugin offers halo masking and hexabining to anonymise geospatial datasets. <br>
			  The <b>Annonymise</b> tab permits these tasks, after the geospatial file is loaded into QGIS from the file system:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="#masking">GeoMasking</a></li>
				<li><a href="#hexabinning">Hexabinning</a></li>
			</ul>
		  	  
		  <!-- Each of these techniques is described below. </p>  -->
         

          <h3 id="masking">Geographic masking</h3>
					<p>Geographic masks are a set of techniques that alter the location of points in a map to protect privacy without overly affecting any spatial patterns. In other words, <i>geographic masks allow researchers to publish useful maps of approximate locations, without exposing sensitive data or violating anyone's privacy</i>. Of course, this is a trade-off: with more masking comes more privacy, but this privacy comes as the cost of <i>information loss</i>. If we apply too much masking to our data, the end result may not resemble the original data whatsoever. While the balance between privacy and information loss can be tricky, its best to air on the side of privacy.</p>
				
					<p> Mapsafe uses the <a href="https://maskmy.xyz/" target="_blank"<font color="blue">Maskmy.XYZ</font> </a> tool for masking. The tool performs donut masking, which is a funny term for a simple concept: moving each point randomly between a minimum and maximum distance. 
					<br>
					A more comprehensive explanation about the masking feature can be found on this <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/tgis.12606" target="_blank" <font color="blue">document.</font> </a> </p>

		  <h4 id="spruillsmeasure"> Spruill's Measure </h4>

			<p>Ensuring privacy requires masked locations to be further from the original points, whereas maintaining utility entails the opposite. 
			To this end, we assist users determine whether their chosen minimum and maximum boundaries are adequate in preventing the locations 
			from being vulnerable to re-identification. The <b>Spruill's measure</b> yields a privacy rating based on the percentage of masked 
			points that are closer to any of the original points (refer to this <a href="https://www.academia.edu/download/44314891/Geographically_masking_health_data_to_pr20160401-7271-i9c9r4.pdf" target="_blank"<font color="blue">paper</font> </a>). 
			To ensure privacy, Ema can keep adjusting the boundaries until a reasonable rating is achieved. 

			<p>This measure was adopted in the <b>MaskMy.XYZ</b> application (<a href="https://www.maskmy.xyz" target="_blank"<font color="blue">https://www.maskmy.xyz</font> </a>) to assist users in geomasking. 
			For the same purpose, <b>MapSafe.XYZ</b> geo-privacy application (<a href="https://www.mapsafe.xyz" target="_blank"<font color="blue">https://www.mapsafe.xyz</font> </a>) also uses this feature. Once masked, the layers can be saved using the <b>Save</b> button. 

		 <br><br>

		  <h4>Halo masking</h4>	

		  	<p>The first step in the geoprivacy plugin performs geographical masking to create masked representations of the
			original geographic dataset. The resulting datasets is shared with trusted users at different levels, to give them an
			approximate location of the sensitive locations they want to hide.

			Two Level masking allows two annonymised datasets to be created. The second level consists of a dataset that is masked with twice the user provided 
			minimum and maximum distances. 

			<p>After uploading their confidential point-based geospatial dataset in QGIS, users define the following two parameters to transform point data: 
			(a) Minimum and (b) maximum masking distance. These two parameters are used to transform each point data to a specific distance at a random angle.
			Then also specify if they want to perform an additional level of masking.
			<br><br> 


		  The three levels of masked datasets correlates with the following types of users:
		    <ul>
				<li> Trusted users who can have access to the original geographic dataset.</a></li>
				<li> Semi-trusted users who are trusted to some extent who need to see only an approximate locations in the map.</a></li>
				<li> Untrusted users who are not trusted and should only see a heavily mask map.</a></li>
			</ul>		
			<br>

				<img class="img-responsive thumbnail" src="images/masking_guide.png">
			</div>
			<br>

			<p>To accommodate these three sets of users we generate two sets of masked datasets of the original dataset, to
			cater for users with different security access. In doing so, the first level contains the original dataset, the second level
			is masked using the parameters provided by the user, while for the third level masking, the same parameters are used, 
			but increased by a certain constant. Using these masks not only provide stronger privacy protection but also produce
			results that are more like the original data than previous generations of geographic masks.

			<br><br>
			<h3 id="hexabinning">Hexagonal binning</h3>
			
			<p>Hexagonal binning (hexbinning) is the other option for anonymising geospatial datasets in the MapSafe plugin. 
			 This feature permits visualising the density of points and can be used instead of geomasking. 
			 Geographic points are aggregated into hexagonal cells using Uber's <a href="https://github.com/uber/h3-py/" target="_blank"<font color="blue">h3-py library</font> </a> 
             Hexagons with more points are represented by darker cells, while those with fewer points are represented by lighter cells. 
			 Users can choose the spatial resolution (i.e., the Uber H3 spatial indexing level) along with the buffer radius for encoding.
             The buffer radius (in KM) allows specification of how far the coverage of the binning should span. </p>

          <br><br>

		  <h4 id="hexabinning">Binning using the MapSafe Plugin</h4>

			<p>A suitable resolution must be chosen to balance privacy and utility depending on the area depicted in the dataset. 
			Large hexagons (lower resolution) would show many distant locations in the same cell, whereas small 
			hexagons (higher resolution) might show results that are too sparse to cover the entire area (refer to this <a href="https://geography.wisc.edu/geods/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2022/05/2021_TGIS_FederatedLearning.pdf" target="_blank"<font color="blue">paper</font> </a>). 
			Therefore, a resolution needs to chosen that covers the entire area (i.e., dense representations) and 
			contains a small cell size (i.e., preserving location details) to better balance the trade-off between 
			spatial coverage and location details than other H3 indexing levels (<a href="https://geography.wisc.edu/geods/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2022/05/2021_TGIS_FederatedLearning.pdf" target="_blank"<font color="blue">paper</font> </a>). 
			Ema chooses a resolution of 7 (the level of a small city) for the all_clusters_kamloops dataset 
			and the results are shown in Figure below. The hexabinning process of generating hexabins and displaying them is instantaneous.

			<br>
			<p>After pressing the Binning button, two binned layers are generated.  
			This two layers caters for different user trust levels, as in the masking scheme. These layers also contain the counts.
			<ul>
				<li><a href="#firstlayer"> one with the user-provided resolution, and</a></li>
				<li><a href="#second;ayer"> the other with one extra binning resolution</a></li>
			</ul>

			<br>
			The first generated layer is for the binning resolution
