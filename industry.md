Research Projects

The following are the academic research projects I have undertaken.

- People and Processes during OSS Decision-making (2015-2021)
Project: The success of an open source software development (OSSD) community is
attributed to the underlying governance model that appreciated by its community
members. The longevity of such a community depends on making good decisions and
hence understanding how consensus-based decision making is enacted. This study
undertakes a qualitative, data-driven study to understand how consensus decisions are
made in OSS, using the case study of Python – a well-known OSS project. The process
of achieving consensus during decision making is investigated based on NLP content
analysis of interactions between Python developers in mailing.

― University of the South Pacific: GIS Web-based Course Portal (2004)
The GIS Course Portal project was undertaken so students outside the USP campus can study GIS courses
online by visualizing, analyzing map resources, and submitting projects using the Internet. I configured Oracle
9iAS Portal to store and present course information and materials; implementing online student work
submission, creating maps using GeoMedia Web Map and integrating it within the Portal.

― University of the South Pacific: GIS Pacific Island Web Atlas (2004)
To create a South Pacific Island Web Atlas providing geographical maps of all the twelve USP member
countries available over the Web. I built the Atlas using GeoMedia Web Map technology.

― USP: Master Thesis - Security Solutions for Spatial Data In-Storage (2003-2006)
My research provided a reasonably efficient alternative storage security solution for file-based spatial data in
n-tier GIS environment. A File System within Database Instance (FSDB) was proposed for as a safe and more
secure storage for spatial data in various file formats within a centralized authentication and access control
mechanism in legacy DBMS. Encryption was used for further protection of stored data
