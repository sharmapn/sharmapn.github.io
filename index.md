I graduated with a PhD in Information science from the Otago University in May 2021. In my reserach, I explored a framework to mine decision making processes and the rationale behind decisions in open source software development communities. I focused on a qualitative, data-driven approach to understand how consensus decisions are made in the Python community project and then creating a semi-automatic framework that mines this information. The last of four published papers was at last year’s International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE) – an A* ranked conference. We subsequently examined influence tactics in the Bitcoin community, a paper on which was accepted at the International Conference in Information Systems (ICIS) – another A* ranked conference.

My last role was a Postdoctoral Fellow role at the Department of Environment at the University of Auckland.  I has primarily been involved in research on data sovereignty and Maori biodiversity management data in Aotearoa NZ. This research is part of a larger National Science Challenges funded project called Ngā Rākau Taketake—Myrtle Rust and Kauri Dieback Research that focused on investigating the use of technology to protect Biodiversity . <br> <br>

Our work has resulted in two separate browser-based tools, which I developed and these have been reported in two papers.
Our first paper “MapSafe: A complete tool for achieving geospatial data sovereignty” (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/tgis.13094) describes how their browser-based tool (https://www.mapsafe.xyz) offers a complete approach for sovereign data owners to safeguard sensitive geospatial data by obfuscating, encrypting, and notarising it. Sovereign parties can first verify the encrypted dataset’s originality, decrypt, and then display it. These functions run client-side in the browser, meaning geospatial data never leaves the computer unprotected, presenting a completely trustless mechanism for sharing data. We believe this tool presents a key ingredient in geospatial data sovereignty. The second tool focuses on empowering Indigenous peoples to govern data about themselves, their territories, resources, and ways of life, collected by themselves or others https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/tgis.13153. Customised and novel implementations of each of the security functions (obfuscation, encryption, and notarisation) are integrated within GeoNode content management system and are made available through the browser permitting Indigenous peoples to safeguard and share these datasets themselves before storage on the cloud. The application was designed for the protection of Biodiversity Management Areas stewarded by the Māori people in Aotearoa New Zealand.
