I am a Research Fellow at the GIScience Team, Department of Environment at the University of Auckland, New Zealand. <br><br>

My research is mainly in the Data Sovereignty tools for Indigenous communities. My research is funded by the ... My research topics include: spatial data security, and decision-making within software ecosystems, . .<br><br>
      
My research interests are in decision-making and spatial data security. 

- After researching on decision-making processes in OSS communities, I want to further examine the following topics by supervising Master’s research students: (a) if and which core developer’s preference matters in decision-making in these communities? (b) how sentiments change after project leader steps down, and (c) who influences decisions. 

- In spatial data security, I want to supervise a research student to design and develop an in-house data storage repository that can provide more features that traditional file servers – an extension of my own master’s thesis. My future interests are on human decision-making based on collective intelligence.
