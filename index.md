I am a Research Fellow at the GIScience Team, Department of Environment at the University of Auckland, New Zealand. 
I am working on a project which focuses on providing Data sovereignty for Indigenous people. We are building a tool which will obfuscate, secure, and notarize spatial datasets.

I graduated with a PhD in Information science from the Otago University in May 2021. In my research, I identified and extracted Decision-making processes from OSS email archived of the Python community. The last of four published papers was at last year’s International Conference on Software Engineering – an A* ranked conference. We subsequently examined influence tactics in the Bitcoin community and published a paper at the International Conference in Information Systems – another A+ ranked conference.
