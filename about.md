My Research Fellow role at the University of Auckland, was within the GIScience team in the Department of Environment. In my role we developed two geospatial data sovereignty tools. The project involved both designing and building a state-of-the-art web architecture and interface to mask, encrypt, and notarize spatial data. The project had a special interest in protecting indigenous data, relating to forest biodiversity data. It came at a particularly important moment for Aotearoa New Zealand, as there has been a surge in biodiversity challenges that require diverse datasets to be integrated into analysis â€“ often containing sensitive and indigenous knowledge.

I have worked as a University Lecturer at the University of Fiji for two and a half years. I developed completely new courses by doing extensive subject area research. These courses, both at undergraduate and post graduate levels were based on emerging technologies and provide a strong industry focus. I emphasized on the practical aspect in these courses introducing latest technologies. I also undertook a number of projects: web and mobile application development projects using students. Students appreciated and were attracted to the practical nature of the courses. I took a ``coaching style'' approaches to accomplish student IT projects, including regularly staying behind to help students in their projects resulting in some very good software projects .
My teaching experience are outlined <a href="/teaching.html">here</a>.

I have used text mining, natural language processing, repository analysis, social network analysis in my research. I have also developed new methods and tools where necessary. My research has been published in the the proceedings of the these conferences: International Conference in Software Engineering (ICSE), International Conference in Information Systems (ICIS), International Conference in Evaluation and Assesment on Software Engineering (EASE), and Asia Pacific Software Engineering Conference (APSEC), among others.

Before starting at the University of Auckland, I was a PhD candidate at University of Otago, where I obtained my PhD in 2021.
My <a href="https://ourarchive.otago.ac.nz/handle/10523/10895" target="_blank">PhD dissertation</a> focused on mining information on people and processes during OSS decision-making. I recieved a MS in Computing Science from University of the South Pacific in 2007 and a BSc from the same University in 2001.<br>

I have also worked in the industry for six years: as a software developer, database administrator and a business analyst at various public and private sector organisations.  These experiences are outlined <a href="/industry.html">here</a>.

I am  originally from Lautoka, Fiji. I currently live in Auckland, New Zealand with my wife.<br>
