I am a Research Fellow at the University of Auckland, New Zealand  within the GIScience team in the Department of Environment. I lead the Human Aspects of Software Engineering Lab (HASEL), check it out at <a href="https://hasel.auckland.ac.nz/" target="_blank">https://hasel.auckland.ac.nz</a>.
The senior lecturer title is equivalent to associate professor in North American, European, and Asian universities
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_ranks_(Australia_and_New_Zealand)" target="_blank">see here</a>).<br>

In my role we are developing a prototype of a Spatial Data Sovereignty tool. The project involves both designing and building a state-of-the-art web architecture and interface to mask, encrypt, and notarize spatial data. The project has a special interest in protecting indigenous data, specifically as it relates to forest biodiversity data. It comes at a particularly important moment for Aotearoa New Zealand, as there has been a surge in biodiversity challenges that require diverse datasets to be integrated into analysis – often containing sensitive and indigenous knowledge.

I have worked as a University Lecturer at the University of Fiji for two and a half years.  While teaching graduate and postgraduate courses, I emphasized on the practical aspect of the courses introducing latest technologies. I also undertook a number of projects: web and mobile application development projects using students. Students appreciated and were attracted to the practical nature of the courses. I regularly staying behind to help them complete theirs assignments and projects.

Pankaj came with a blend of academic and industrial development skills background which the department needed for some time. Since he has joined us, Pankaj has worked industriously within the department delivering final year and post-graduate Computing Science courses and undertaking projects within the University. Pankaj’s skills were used mainly in the Programing, Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence area of the Computing Science department. 
Pankaj has been actively involved in the department initiative to review and upgrade the IT/CS course structures. He engaged extensively in researching on course structures of other institutions and liaising with the External Advisor. Pankaj engaged as a key member of the Review team, spending numerous hours devising new course structures for the University. Also, we have seen Pankaj contributing and guiding continuously as we implement the new structures. He has indeed provided a very high valued and quality contribution.
In terms of teaching, Pankaj has done exceptionally well. He has deployed “coaching style “approaches to accomplish student IT projects resulting in some very good software projects. This includes the following notable projects: University Timetable Generation System, Student Online Course Registration, Students Information System and Diabetes Mobile Application. Having had commercial experience in his areas, Pankaj has been pushing for excellence in his area of teaching by devoting more time and effort for student learning. Student feedback has been good. 
Pankaj has displayed strong research capability. He has developed completely new courses by doing extensive subject area research. These courses, both at undergraduate and post graduate levels are based on emerging technologies and provide a strong industry focus. The department has been benefiting from Pankaj’s resourcefulness. He has also been involved in orienting other staff members in curriculum research work."




I look forward to the follwoing opprtunities in an academic lecturing role.
-	Teaching – I have taught final year and postgraduate level courses as a University Lecturer. 
- Research - 
-	Industrial consultation – using my Industrial background, I would like to assist in carrying out real world application development for a University as well as external organisations. 
-	Coaching students to build real-world applications, as I previously did as a University Lecturer

My research is mainly in the human and social aspects of software engineering. I take a socio-technical perspective, considering the interaction between the social and technical aspects of software engineering. Some of my current research projects include:
<ul>
<li><b>Automated Updates of Software Dependencies.</b> Most modern software systems depend on existing software components, such as packages, libraries, or modules. When critical issues (e.g. security vulnerabilities) are discovered and fixed in a software component, the dependent software systems should include these fixes by updating to the latest version. However, changes in a software component can cause critical failures in the dependent software if the new version includes breaking changes. Each software system that depends on the component will need to update their code to accommodate these breaking changes, making it difficult to automate the update process. This project is investigating novel, advanced methods to automate this process.</li>
<li><b>Software Developer Diversity and Inclusion.</b> Despite the recent push to increase diversity, tech jobs remain dominated by men. Women represent less than 25% of the tech workforce at companies like Google and Facebook. The representation is even worse in Open Source Software (OSS), where less than 10% of developers are women. We know that gender diversity on software teams brings many benefits (e.g., improved productivity, innovation, and user experience). It is, therefore, critical to attract and retain women in tech. Yet, women have significantly higher turnover rates (twice as high as men), with many leaving to pursue jobs outside of tech. This project is examining barriers to retention and best practices for inclusive software teams.</li>
<li><b>Automated Software Requirement Analytics.</b> The modern software landscape is highly competitive. Software companies need to quickly fix reported bugs and release requested new features, or they risk negative reviews and reduced market share. Online user feedback can provide software improvement insights to software developers. However, the sheer volume of feedback makes manual analysis time-consuming and cost- prohibitive. This project investigates automated techniques to extract and present software requirements from online user feedback data across a variety of feedback channels, for example app store reviews, social media, and question and answer forums. We are also investigating the representativeness of this feedback and how more diverse user needs can be considered by these techniques.</li>
</ul>

I have used a variety of both qualitative and quantitative empirical research methods including developing new methods and tools, text mining,
repository analysis, and social network analysis. My research has been published in the the proceedings of the these conferences: International Conference in Software Engineering (ICSE), International Conference in Information Systems (ICIS), International Conference in Evaluation and Assesment in Software Engineering (EASE), and Asia Pacific Software Engineering Conference (APSEC), among others.

Before starting at the University of Auckland, I was a lecturer at University of Fiji for two and a half years.
Prior to that, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Software Engineering Global interAction Lab in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Victoria, Canada.

I have also worked in the industry for six years: both a software developer, database administrator and a business analyst at various public and private sector organisations. This includes roles where I worked with backend and frontend technologies. I have developed desktop, web and mobile applications using a number of languages. I have a good work ethic and I have constantly put my heart into development shown by the number of projects I have completed. 

I obtained my PhD from Otago University in 2021.
My <a href="./publications/blincoe_thesis.pdf" target="_blank">PhD dissertation</a> focused on methods to facilitate timely and efficient coordination between software developers. I recieved a MS in Computing Science from University of the South Pacific in 2007 and a BSc from the same University in 2001.<br>

I am  originally from Lautoka, Fiji. I currently live in Auckland, New Zealand with my wife.<br>
