Research Projects

I am looking forward to supervise research students in OSS decision-making and spatial data security.  
- Continuing my research on decision-making processes in OSS communities, I am interested in development of automated tools that examine these aspects: 
   - if and which developers' preference matters in decision-making in these communities? 
   - how sentiments change after project leader steps down? and 
   - who influences decisions? 
   - whether social connections (“knowing key members”) affects likelihood of participation (e.g. bug reporting, enhancement reporting and in decision-making)

- In spatial data security, I want to focus on the development of an in-house DBMS-based data storage repository that can provide more features that traditional file servers – an extension of my own master’s thesis. 

My future interests are on human decision-making based on collective intelligence.
