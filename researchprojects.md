I have worked as a University Lecturer for two and a half years. I also have more than six years application development commercial work experience in the public and private sector. 

Teaching

I look forward to the follwoing opprtunities in an academic lecturing role.
•	Teaching – I have taught final year and postgraduate level courses as a University Lecturer. 
•	Industrial consultation – using my Industrial background, I would like to assist in carrying out real world application development for a University as well as external organisations. 
•	Coaching students to build real-world applications, as I previously did as a University Lecturer

Research

I am looking forward to supervise research students in OSS decision-making and spatial data security.  
- Continuing my research on decision-making processes in OSS communities, I want to examine these topics: (a) if and which developers' preference matters in decision-making in these communities? (b) how sentiments change after project leader steps down? and (c) who influences decisions? 
- In spatial data security, I want to supervise a research student to design and develop an in-house data storage repository that can provide more features that traditional file servers – an extension of my own master’s thesis. My future interests are on human decision-making based on collective intelligence.
