Research Projects

I am looking forward to supervise research students in OSS decision-making and spatial data security.  
- Continuing my research on decision-making processes in OSS communities, I want to examine these topics: (a) if and which developers' preference matters in decision-making in these communities? (b) how sentiments change after project leader steps down? and (c) who influences decisions? 
- In spatial data security, I want to supervise a research student to design and develop an in-house data storage repository that can provide more features that traditional file servers – an extension of my own master’s thesis. My future interests are on human decision-making based on collective intelligence.
